# matrix-termination
Implementation for proving termination of string rewriting systems using matrix interpretations, as outlined in the paper by [Hofbauer and Waldmann](link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11805618_25).
Termination problems are taken from the [Termination Problems Database](https://github.com/TermCOMP/TPDB).
